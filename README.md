## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harry Shield and I am currently a 3rd year majoring in Biochemistry with a Data Science Minor. I hope to use the skills I learn in data science to assist my medical career in the future. In my free time I love cooking, watching basketball, playing golf, and fiddling around with music. Feel free to reach out to me through fyr5ht@virginia.edu
